# 2. Best Practices for Git Version Control

## Recommended Branch Strategy

```text
main
 ├── dev
 │    ├── feature/rag-pipeline
 │    ├── feature/multi-agent
 │    ├── feature/frontend
 │    ├── fix/retrieval-bug
 │    └── experiment/new-router
```

---

## Recommended Workflow

### main
Stable production-ready code.

### dev
Main development branch.

### feature/*
New features.

### fix/*
Bug fixes.

### experiment/*
Research or experimental features.

---

# Commit Best Practices

## Good Commit Examples

```bash
git commit -m "Add hybrid retrieval pipeline"
```

```bash
git commit -m "Fix ChromaDB metadata parsing"
```

```bash
git commit -m "Refactor agent orchestration service"
```

---

## Bad Commit Examples

```bash
git commit -m "update"
```

```bash
git commit -m "fix"
```

```bash
git commit -m "asdf"
```

---

# 3. Useful Git Commands

# Repository Initialization

## Initialize git

```bash
git init
```

## Clone repository

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

---

# Branching

## Create new branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
```

## Switch branch

```bash
git checkout dev
```

## List branches

```bash
git branch
```

---

# Staging and Commit

```bash
git add .
```

## Add specific file

```bash
git add backend/services/llm_service.py
```

## Commit changes

git pull origin dev
```

---

# Merge

## Merge branch into current branch

```bash
git merge feature/my-feature

git stash pop
```

---

# Remote Management

## Add remote

```bash
git remote add origin <repository_url>
```

## Check remotes

git remote -v
```

---

# 4. Version Control Rules

# Rule 1
Never commit:

- datasets
- model weights
- checkpoints
- GGUF models
- secrets
- API keys
- .env files
- logs

---

# Rule 2
Always use branches.

Do NOT develop directly on:

- main
- production

---

# Rule 3
Keep commits focused.

One commit = one logical change.

---

# Rule 4
Write meaningful commit messages.

---

# Rule 5
Pull latest changes before pushing.

```bash
git pull origin dev
```

---

# Rule 6
Use pull requests for major changes.

---

# Rule 7
Tag stable releases.

Example:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
```

---

# Rule 8
Use .gitignore properly.

Recommended ignores:

```gitignore
# Python
__pycache__/
*.pyc

# Virtual environments
venv/
.env/

# Models
models/
training/outputs/

# Logs
logs/

# Datasets
training/datasets/raw/

# Notebook checkpoints
.ipynb_checkpoints/
```

---

# Rule 9
Separate experiments from production.

Use:

```text
experiment/*
```

for:
- research
- temporary ideas
- unstable pipelines

---

# Rule 10
Document architectural changes.

Whenever:
- adding pipelines
- changing orchestration
- modifying retrieval
- introducing agents

update:

- docs/architecture.md
- docs/pipeline.md
- README.md

---

# Recommended Development Flow

```text
1. Create feature branch
2. Implement feature
3. Commit changes
4. Test locally
5. Push branch
6. Open pull request
7. Review and merge into dev
8. Merge dev into main after validation
```

---

# Recommended AI Engineering Practices

## Separate Responsibilities

Avoid putting everything inside one file.

Good separation:

- services
- pipelines
- retrieval
- prompts
- models
- configs
- deployment

---

## Keep YAML Configurable

Avoid hardcoding:

- model names
- paths
- prompts
- generation settings
- runtime configs

---

## Track Experiments

Always save:

- metrics
- prompts
- datasets
- configs
- model versions

---

## Use Structured Outputs

Prefer:

```json
{
  "answer": "..."
}
```

instead of raw text.

---

## Maintain Observability

Track:

- latency
- token usage
- retrieval quality
- hallucination rate
- routing decisions
- agent outputs

---

# Final Notes

This workspace template is designed to scale from:

- personal AI projects
- research projects
- RAG systems
- multi-agent systems
- enterprise AI applications
- production inference systems

The architecture intentionally separates:

- inference
- orchestration
- retrieval
- training
- deployment
- evaluation
- observability

so the system remains:

- modular
- maintainable
- scalable
- production-ready
